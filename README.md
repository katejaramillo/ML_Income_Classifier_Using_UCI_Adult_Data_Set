# ML_Income_Classifier_Using_UCI_Adult_Data_Set

Welcome to my project! This assignment includes different machine learning algorithms used to make predictions about whether an individual's income will be over $50,000 based on a variety of factors. It begins with simple data cleaning and analysis, followed by ridge and lasso regressions, and ends with evaluation of random forests.
